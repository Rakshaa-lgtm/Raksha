  Mr prefect! 💗<br><br>

  Happy Birthday to the man who truly lives up to his name in every sense of the word!
  As we celebrate another year of your life, I’ve been reflecting on the several years
  we’ve spent as friends and how much of a blessing you have been to me.
  Even though you are older and I’ve always looked up to you, you have this amazing way
  of treating me like a true peer, and your friendship has become one of the most important
  parts of my life.<br><br>

  I want you to know today that you are genuinely the sweetest and kindest person I have
  ever encountered; you have been my rock, my safe haven, and the best “therapist” I could
  ever ask for. I can never forget how you were the one to reach out and pull me up when I
  was at my lowest, and how you always seem to know exactly what to say to make the world
  feel right again.<br><br>

  You give so much of your heart to others, and today, I hope you finally let the world
  give back to you. I feel so incredibly lucky to know you and to learn from your wisdom
  and your grace. May this birthday bring you as much peace and happiness as you have given
  me over the years, because a soul as beautiful as yours deserves nothing less than the
  very best.<br><br>

  Happy Birthday, my wonderful friend!<br><br>
